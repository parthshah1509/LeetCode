Implement union and intersection of two array(in a efficient way).

Additional information given by the interviewer was: elements of the two given array may be repeated but cannot be repeated in union and intersection array.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Union : (Assuming order of element doesn't matter )

Put all the elements of both arrays in HashSet , now Hashset will have union of both the arrays.

Intersection: (Assuming order of element doesn't matter )

Put all the elements of one array in HashSet.
Iterate over other array and check whether element is present HashSet created in previous step if yes include it in intersection result else ignore.
